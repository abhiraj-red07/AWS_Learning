What is a region ?
Region is a cluster of data centres that are present globally.

What is an Availability Zone?
• Each region has many availability zones(usually 3, min is 3, max is 6)
• Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
• They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters
• They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking

Why companies use more than one availability zones ?
Companies use multiple AZs to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, data safety, and zero-downtime operations.
